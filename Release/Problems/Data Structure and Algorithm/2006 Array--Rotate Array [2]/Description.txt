Time Limit 1000ms

¡¾Description¡¿
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated 
to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

¡¾Sample¡¿
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] n = 7, k = 5

¡¾Result¡¿
[3,4,5,6,7,1,2]

¡¾Sample¡¿
[1,2,3,4,5] n = 5, k = 2

¡¾Result¡¿
[4,5,1,2,3]

¡¾Framework¡¿
C Version:
void rotate(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
    
}

C++ Version:
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
}
